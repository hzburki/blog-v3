## Why I Moved My Domain from AWS to Cloudflare

I recently decided to transfer my domain from AWS to Cloudflare to test their services and explore features like DDoS protection. As a developer who manages several personal projects, I'm always looking for the most efficient and cost-effective solutions for domain management and hosting.

In this guide, I'll walk you through the exact process I used to transfer my domain from AWS to Cloudflare and deploy my Astro-built blog. By following these steps, you'll avoid the confusion and technical hiccups I encountered along the way.

## Domain Transfer Process: AWS to Cloudflare

The domain transfer process involves steps on both the AWS and Cloudflare sides. Let's break it down into manageable steps.

### Preparing Your Domain in AWS

1. Log in to your AWS account and navigate to Route53.
2. Locate your domain in the "Registered domains" section.
3. Disable the Transfer Lock feature (look for "Transfer Lock: On" and change it to Off).
4. Wait for the transfer lock to deactivate completely (this takes a few seconds).
5. Click on the "Transfer out" dropdown menu and select "Transfer to another registrar."
6. Note down the Authorization Code provided â€“ you'll need this for Cloudflare.
7. Remove the WHOIS privacy protection (while not strictly necessary, this can prevent complications with some registrars).

### Initiating the Transfer in Cloudflare

1. Log in to your Cloudflare account and navigate to "Domain Registration."
2. Go to the "Transfer domain" section.
3. If you don't see the option to add a domain, try hard refreshing the page with <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> (or <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> on Windows).
4. Enter your domain name when prompted.
5. Select "Quick Scan for DNS records" when asked how to handle DNS records.
6. Choose your plan (the Free plan works for most personal projects).
7. Continue to the activation page, where Cloudflare will provide instructions for nameserver changes.

  If you encounter issues with existing CNAME records showing up, you may need
  to delete the domain from Cloudflare and start again, ensuring all previous
  records are cleared.

### Completing the Transfer

1. Navigate to "Transfer a domain you own" option in Cloudflare.
2. Enter your domain and review the transfer fee that Cloudflare will charge.
3. Enter the authorization code you received from AWS.
4. Verify your contact details, address, and payment information.
5. Click "Confirm and Finalize Transfer" to complete the process.
6. Watch for emails from both AWS and Cloudflare regarding the transfer.
7. Respond to the AWS email (usually arrives within minutes) to approve and expedite the transfer.

  Without your explicit approval, domain transfers can take up to 5 days.
  Responding to the AWS confirmation email speeds up the process significantly.

## Deploying an Astro Site to Cloudflare Pages

While waiting for the domain transfer to complete, you can go ahead and deploy your website to Cloudflare Pages.

### Connecting Your GitHub Repository

1. Navigate to the "Workers & Pages" tab in your Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Select the "Pages" tab.
3. Click on "Connect to Git" and authorize GitHub when prompted.
4. Select the repository containing your Astro project.
5. Choose "Astro" as the Framework preset to apply recommended build settings.
6. Click "Deploy" to start the deployment process.

### Setting Up Your Custom Domain

1. Once deployment completes, go to the "Custom domains" tab.
2. Add the domain you're transferring to Cloudflare.
3. Note the CNAME value provided by Cloudflare.
4. Navigate to "Account Home" from the side menu and select your domain.
5. Update the DNS records by adding the CNAME with the values provided.
6. Return to the Pages section, find the custom domain tab, and click "Activate domain."
7. Wait for the domain to activate (usually a few minutes, though Cloudflare says it may take up to 48 hours).

  issues.

1. Domain transfers require disabling security features on the sending side before initiating the transfer.
2. Authorization codes are essential for domain transfers and are provided by your current registrar.
3. Responding quickly to confirmation emails significantly speeds up the transfer process.
4. DNS record conflicts can occur if you've previously attempted to add your domain to Cloudflare.
5. Browser caching can make it appear that domain transfers or DNS changes haven't taken effect when they actually have.

This entire process took me less than a day to complete, though your experience may vary depending on how quickly your registrar processes the transfer. The deployment to Cloudflare Pages was particularly smooth thanks to their built-in support for Astro projects.
