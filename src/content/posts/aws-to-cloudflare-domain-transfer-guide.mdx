I decided to transfer my domain from AWS to Cloudflare to test their services. Here's my experience transferring the domain and deploying my Astro blog.

## Domain Transfer Process: AWS to Cloudflare

### Step 1: Prepare Your Domain in AWS

1. Log into your AWS account and navigate to Route53
2. Find your domain in the "Registered domains" section
3. Disable the "Transfer Lock" feature through the "Actions" dropdown (may take a few seconds)
4. Select "Transfer to another registrar" from the "Transfer out" dropdown
5. Save the Authorization Code. You will need it later.
6. Remove WHOIS privacy protection (optional but recommended to avoid potential transfer issues)

  AWS will definitely update their UI over time, so I am not sharing screenshots
  of the process. The core functionalities should remain available, though their
  exact location might change.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Initiate Transfer in Cloudflare

1. Log into Cloudflare and go to "Domain Registration"
2. If transfer options aren't visible, try hard refreshing (<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> for Macs or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> for Windows)
3. Select "Transfer a domain you own" and enter your domain
4. Choose "Quick Scan for DNS records". This will scan your domain for existing records and provide a list of records to transfer.
5. Select your plan and remove any conflicting DNS records
6. Continue to activation

### Step 3: Complete Transfer and Wait

1. Update nameservers and disable DNSSEC if required (this was already disabled for me in the AWS Dashboard)
2. Enter the AWS authorization code
3. Verify your contact details and payment information
4. Confirm and finalize the transfer
5. Watch for the AWS confirmation email (usually arrives within minutes)
6. Approve the transfer immediately to expedite the process
7. Without approval, transfers can take up to 5 days

## Deploying an Astro Blog to Cloudflare Pages

While waiting for the domain transfer to complete, you can get a head start on deploying your Astro blog:

### Deploy and Connect

1. Go to "Workers & Pages" → "Pages" in Cloudflare
2. Connect to GitHub and select your Astro repository
3. Choose "Astro" from Framework presets (this configures build settings)
4. Click "Deploy" to start the build process
5. After deployment, go to "Custom domains" and add your domain
6. Add the provided CNAME value to your DNS records
7. Return to Pages and click "Activate domain"

<Callout client:load type="info">
  Even if your domain hasn't fully transferred yet, you can still set up the
  Pages configuration. The connection will activate once the transfer completes.
</Callout>

## Verification and Next Steps

Domain activation usually happens quickly but can take up to 48 hours. If your site doesn't appear, try checking in a different browser to avoid cache issues.

<Callout client:load type="success">
  Success! While my main browser showed caching issues, testing in a fresh
  browser session confirmed both the domain transfer and deployment worked.
</Callout>

Now that everything is on Cloudflare, I'll explore their DDoS protection, CDN performance, and security features. This migration gives me a perfect testing ground for Cloudflare's ecosystem while maintaining my blog.

Have you tried Cloudflare? Which features do you find most useful?
